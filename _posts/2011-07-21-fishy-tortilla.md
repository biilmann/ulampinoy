Tortilla espa√±ola is the perfect brunch... specially on Fridays.

A complete meal in itself, it has all the [Go-Grow-Glow][1] components.

Potatoes as carbs; eggs, and in this case, more protein from the mackerel; the rest of the ingredients as vitamin and mineral plus the healthy oils if you use virgin olive oil.

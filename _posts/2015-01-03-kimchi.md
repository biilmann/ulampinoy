<p class="lead">Spicy and sour are the flavors that could compliment any dish and enhance your appetite. Kimchi is both, spicy and sour.</p>

It's not easy to find a good kimchi here in Madrid. The bottled kimchi available at the Chinese store taste sweet! Really? Sweet kimchi? No thanks!

We found a proper Korean store in the Mercado de Maravillas in Cuatro Caminos. The shopkeeper is a Korean lady making her own kimchi. The homemade kimchi she makes and sells is great but we thought that the spicy factor was toned down a bit for the Spanish market. Spaniards in general have a low tolerance with the heat level of chilis.

As the always the case, we took the matter on our own hands. We pretty much have had some great kimchi in the Philippines so we know what a delicious kimchi was. At least, for us.
Authentic is great but making it your own and making is is just more awesome.

**Coming soon:** Video recipe of how we made our version of Kimchi mainly inspired by [Maangchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sX_wDCbeuU)
